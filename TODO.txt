• Rewrite Reader: it's ugly, non general (if we change types in utility). We have to rewrite a generale converter from strings to whatever type we have to vonvert it to: eg
    size_type generalConvert(string,size_type) (maybe with a template)

• gtests: we need to implement google tests (google provides a testing framework for testing functions). Install gtets and gmock on yu machine (I wasnt able to on vagrant)

• UML class graph

• PQ orders

• python plots (after all the above)
